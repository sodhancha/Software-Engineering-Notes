*“if you don’t have time to do it right once, how will you find the time to do it twice?”*

# Problem Statement
1. Define Problem Statement
	- Be as specific as possible.

	- Clearly identify your target market.

	- Define the size of the market and the problem.

	- Define the current (bad) solution.

	- Remove all instances of the words “we” or “I”

# Why
2. Start with Why ?
	*“Why did the robot stop?”*
		-	The circuit has overloaded, causing a fuse to blow.

	*“Why is the circuit overloaded?”*
		-	There was insufficient lubrication on the bearings, so they locked up.

	*“Why was there insufficient lubrication on the bearings?”*
		-	The oil pump on the robot is not circulating sufficient oil.

	*“Why is the pump not circulating sufficient oil?”*
		-	The pump intake is clogged with metal shavings.

	*“Why is the intake clogged with metal shavings?”*
		-	Because there is no filter on the pump.

# Goals
3. Unrealistic Goals:
	- It’s not always easy, but unrealistic goals are a huge cost to business, and obviously the earlier they are discovered the better. 

# Stakeholders
4. WTF are Key Stakeholders?
	*The folks that care about the project and have a vested-interest or role, which affect or are affected by it*
	For Example:
	-	Customers, clients, and their representatives
	-	Software users
	-	Organization management
	-	Project management and sponsors
	-	Development and Quality Assurance teams
	-	External suppliers, subcontractors, and consultants
	-	Grouchy systems and database administrators (who too rarely get consulted).

5. How to identify a Key Stakeholder ?
	Five Questions to Identify Key Stakeholders,by Graham Kenny:

	-	Does the stakeholder have a fundamental impact on your organization’s performance? (yes)
	-	Can you clearly identify what you want from the stakeholder? (yes)
	-	Is the relationship dynamic — that is, do you want it to grow? (yes)
	-	Can you exist without or easily replace the stakeholder? (no)
	-	Has the stakeholder already been identified through another relationship? (no)

	5.1. *A customer walks into a bar. He asks for a beer made out of wine. The project manager agrees.
Both question the bartender's competence.*

6. On Mockups and Wireframes and UIs
	- 	*don’t produce pretty mockups or they’ll think the project is done before it starts!!! *
	-	Build your UI so that unfinished parts look unfinished.
	-	Leave out features that are not implemented, such as menus buttons, sections, etc. 
		As complete features are added in, progress will be perceived more accurately.

# Requirements
7. On requirements:
	Many of the qualities of successful requirements documents are listed below:
	7.1 Clarity:
		- Writing and critical thinking skills, FTW!

	7.2 Complete:
		- Must address relevant cases, features, and users.

	7.3 Concise:
		- Partially at odds with completeness, this quality facilitates understanding without drowning the reader in unnecessary detail. Don’t over-document (unless paid by the page of course).

	7.4 Consistent:
		- Requirements must not contradict each other. They must be compatible logically, strategically, and grammatically.

	7.5 Achievable:
		- Unless you’ve a breakthrough design for a flux capacitor, your time-travel project will fail.

	7.6 Unambiguous:
		- If two people may interpret the specs differently, they will. This quality is especially important on platform or protocol work, on top of which others will build.

	7.7 Verifiable:
		- Measurable goals should be stated, rather than “works well”, etc.

	7.8 Prioritized:
		- Rank the relative importance of each requirement.

	7.9 Appropriate:
		- Consider the scale of the project in question when writing. More lengthy and formal processes will likely be required as the project grows.

	7.10 Version Controlled:
		-	Requirements docs should be in a version control system with other docs for continued maintenance.

	7.11 Protip: When documenting, involve a technical writer when possible.
	
	7.12 Templates
		 - Below are templates and guidelines for requirements documentation, which may be helpful to get started.

# Design
8. [Start with the Design Chapter and a complete read of it](https://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/sdlc_3_des.html)
	
	8.1 Design phase documents state how you plan to build it.
	
	8.2 Design is a *“form of problem-solving.”*

	8.3 Mistakes are much cheaper to fix in the design stage than backtracking when the whole team is already charging along toward the finish line during construction.

	8.4 [Design Considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ee658124(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#DesignConsiderations)

	8.5 Thoroughly read through the [Design Chapter](https://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/sdlc_3_des.html)

	8.6 Mistake proof your software
