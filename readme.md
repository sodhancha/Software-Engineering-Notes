# Professional Software Development

*“if you don’t have time to do it right once, how will you find the time to do it twice?”*

1. Define Problem Statement
	- Be as specific as possible.

	- Clearly identify your target market.

	- Define the size of the market and the problem.

	- Define the current (bad) solution.

	- Remove all instances of the words “we” or “I”

2. Start with Why ?
	*“Why did the robot stop?”*
		-	The circuit has overloaded, causing a fuse to blow.

	*“Why is the circuit overloaded?”*
		-	There was insufficient lubrication on the bearings, so they locked up.

	*“Why was there insufficient lubrication on the bearings?”*
		-	The oil pump on the robot is not circulating sufficient oil.

	*“Why is the pump not circulating sufficient oil?”*
		-	The pump intake is clogged with metal shavings.

	*“Why is the intake clogged with metal shavings?”*
		-	Because there is no filter on the pump.

3. Unrealistic Goals:
	- It’s not always easy, but unrealistic goals are a huge cost to business, and obviously the earlier they are discovered the better. 

4. WTF are Key Stakeholders?
	*The folks that care about the project and have a vested-interest or role, which affect or are affected by it*
	For Example:
	-	Customers, clients, and their representatives
	-	Software users
	-	Organization management
	-	Project management and sponsors
	-	Development and Quality Assurance teams
	-	External suppliers, subcontractors, and consultants
	-	Grouchy systems and database administrators (who too rarely get consulted).

5. How to identify a Key Stakeholder ?
	Five Questions to Identify Key Stakeholders,by Graham Kenny:

	-	Does the stakeholder have a fundamental impact on your organization’s performance? (yes)
	-	Can you clearly identify what you want from the stakeholder? (yes)
	-	Is the relationship dynamic — that is, do you want it to grow? (yes)
	-	Can you exist without or easily replace the stakeholder? (no)
	-	Has the stakeholder already been identified through another relationship? (no)

6. *A customer walks into a bar. He asks for a beer made out of wine. The project manager agrees.
Both question the bartender's competence.*

7. On Mockups and Wireframes and UIs
	- 	*don’t produce pretty mockups or they’ll think the project is done before it starts!!! *
	-	Build your UI so that unfinished parts look unfinished.
	-	Leave out features that are not implemented, such as menus buttons, sections, etc. 
		As complete features are added in, progress will be perceived more accurately.

8. On requirements:
	Many of the qualities of successful requirements documents are listed below:
	8.1 Clarity:
		- Writing and critical thinking skills, FTW !

	8.2 Complete:
		- Must address relevant cases, features, and users.

	8.3 Concise:
		- Partially at odds with completeness, this quality facilitates understanding without drowning the reader in unnecessary detail. Don’t over-document (unless paid by the page of course).

	8.4 Consistent:
		- Requirements must not contradict each other. They must be compatible logically, strategically, and grammatically. 

	8.5 Achievable:
		- Unless you’ve a breakthrough design for a flux capacitor , your time-travel project will fail.

	8.6 Unambiguous:
		- If two people may interpret the specs differently, they will. This quality is especially important on platform or protocol work, on top of which others will build.

	8.7 Verifiable:
		- Measurable goals should be stated, rather than “works well”, etc.

	8.8 Prioritized:
		- Rank the relative importance of each requirement.

	8.9 Appropriate:
		- Consider the scale of the project in question when writing. More lengthy and formal processes will likely be required as the project grows.

	8.10 Version Controlled:
		-	Requirements docs should be in a version control system with other docs for continued maintenance.

	8.11 Protip: When documenting, involve a technical writer when possible.
	
	8.12 Templates
		 - Below are templates and guidelines for requirements documentation, which may be helpful to get started.

9. Start with the Design Chapter
	
	9.1 design phase documents state how you plan to build it.
	
	9.2 Design is a *“form of problem-solving.”*

	9.3 Mistakes are much cheaper to fix in the design stage than backtracking when the whole team is already charging along toward the finish line during construction.
